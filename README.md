# Let's make a gif

This is (or soon will be) a website that allows users to

- upload a video file and convert it to a gif.
- upload a series of images and convert them to a video or gif.

Other possible functions of the site include:

- video compression (allow users to upload a large file and download a compressed version)
- video / image cropping
- splicing mulitple videos together

All of this functionality can be accomplished quite easily with [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)


## Reminder
A folder named `uploads` and a folder named `images` are expected at the root of the project

*Empty folders are **NOT** uploaded to github*

To work around this, these folders currently contain a `.info` file.

Feel free to remove delete this file as it's just a placeholder to ensure folder is pushed to the repo
